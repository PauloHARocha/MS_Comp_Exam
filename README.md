## Longitudinal Generalized Linear Modeling of Psychological Distress in California: An Investigation of Demographic and Health Factors (2015-2019)

Serious psychological distress presents escalating concerns for public health given its association to numerous adverse health outcomes. This study analyzed data from the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) 2015-2019 to understand factors contributing to psychological distress by applying a longitudinal generalized linear model framework with two strategies: logistic and negative binomial regressions. The study findings indicate an increase in psychological distress over time, influenced by factors like neighborhood safety perception, age, education level, smoking habits, and geographic location. This research underlines the need for targeted mental health strategies and future explorations into additional determinants of serious psychological distress.
